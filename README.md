# NEWS Recommendation Using Generative adversarial neural network.

## Problem Statement
NEWS Recommendation using GAN networks which has two neural nets (i) generative (ii) discriminative.
## ABSTRACT
GAN have two competing neural network models, One takes noise as
input and generates samples and so is called the generator. The other
model, called the discriminator receives samples from both the generator
and the training data, and has to be able to distinguish between the two
sources. 

These two networks play a continuous game, where the
generator is learning to produce more and more realistic samples, and the
discriminator is learning to get better and better at distinguishing
generated data from real data. These two networks are trained
simultaneously.
